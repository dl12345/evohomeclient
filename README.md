# Evohomeclient for Domoticz

C++ hack to the Honeywell Evohome API

## Description

This project takes a lot of its ideas from watchforstock's Python based evohomeclient and an implementation of this client as posted on the Domoticz wiki.

Reason for redeveloping this in C++ is that I run Domoticz on a rather tiny machine and Python is quite heavy 
on resources. And slow. Of course, if you like the lib you can use it for any other project.
